# YouTube Zen Mode

Chrome app that scrapes the distracting stuff off of the youtube pages including shorts, recomended videos, and all of youtube. 
When you block all of youtube your tabs are closed but they are saved so when you re-enable youtube, they are re-opened.

### Future Features
Would like to implement a clock icon on the popup that when you click it causes a flipping animation that reveals a timer you can set
on the other side that will lock your current settings for that ammount of time and display your time ticking down.
